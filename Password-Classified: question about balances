for the deposit and withdrawal function, "filename = username+'.txt'" is the file that is opened for both functions to add or subtract from
however, I am unsure of how to create such a file from the username and password of cust_profile.txt
it is to my understanding that in "file = open(filename,'a')" (line 22) such a file is created for appending if it does not exist but if it does not trouble you too much
would it be possible for you to create one or two examples of a balance file as well?
